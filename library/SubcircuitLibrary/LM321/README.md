# LM321 Operational Amplifier IC

LM321 is a 5 pin Op-Amp IC. It has differential input, is internally compensated. Supply voltage ranges from 3V to 32V. Output is short circuit protected. Its output stage is class B, comprising of push-pull transistors. Hence output contains crossover distortion near mid-rail where neither push or pull transistor is conducting.


## Usage/Examples

Inverting/Non-Inverting Amplifier

Integrator/Summer

Differential Amplifier

Differentiator

Schmitt Trigger

Comparators
