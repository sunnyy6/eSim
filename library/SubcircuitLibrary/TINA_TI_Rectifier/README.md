# Precision_Rectifier IC

Precision Rectifier is a general purpose IC. The major drawback of the normal diode is that it can not be able to rectify the voltages below (0.6 v) which is the cut-in voltage. So, a special type of diode is used which is a precision diode that is capable of rectifying the input voltage signals in the order of milli volt. So, a circuit that uses this special type of diode(precision diode) is called a precision rectifie

## Usage/Examples

It is used in high-precision signal processing with few modification it can be used as Peak Detector.
