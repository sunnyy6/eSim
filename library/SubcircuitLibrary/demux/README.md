# Demux IC

Demux is the de-multiplexer circuit that takes one input line and gives multiple output lines. Basically, itâ€™s a combinational circuit and It always takes one input
line and gives 2n output line, where n is the number of select lines. It is also, known as a serial to parallel converter or data distributor circuit. The 1:2 Demux consist of 1 input line, 1 select line, and produces 2 output line. as, according to the formula no. of the output line is depends on no. of select line, here, in 1:2 demux, no. of output line = 2^n = 2^1 = 2.


## Usage/Examples

It is used in communication systems. 

It is used in serial to parallel converter.
