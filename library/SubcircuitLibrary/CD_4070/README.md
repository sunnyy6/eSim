# CD4070 IC

It is 2-input XOR Gate IC. CD4070 IC is designed with 180nm CMOS technology in eSim consisting four XOR Gates. It plays the role of odd 1â€™s detector. When both inputs are same, then output is LOW. It is also known as Special logic Gate.

## Usage/Examples

Logical Comparators

Adders, Subtractors

Parity Generators and Checkers
