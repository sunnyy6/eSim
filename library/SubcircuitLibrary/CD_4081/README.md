# CD4081 IC

It is 2-input AND Gate IC. CD4081 IC is designed with 180nm CMOS technology in eSim consisting four AND Gates. When both the inputs are HIGH then only output is HIGH, otherwise LOW.


## Usage/Examples

Logic buffers, inverters, and decoders

Implementing logic circuits

Signal conditioning

Enable gate

Inhibit gate

Measurement of frequency
