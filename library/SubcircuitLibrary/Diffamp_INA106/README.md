## Differential Amplifier IC

Differential Amplifier is a type of amplifier circuit which is used to amplify the difference of input and give the output respectively. It is used to remove noise which is present in input signal.

## Usage/Examples

It is used in Amplitude Modulation.

It is used in Audio Amplifier for exact and noiseless volume control.

It is used in Digital and Analog data transmission system for noise cancellation.

It is used for audio and video processing.

It is used as an automatic gain control circuit.

It is used as an electronic switch.

It is used for motor control.
