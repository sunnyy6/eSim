# CD4000 IC

It is dual 3-input NOR Gate IC. CD4000 IC is designed with 180nm CMOS technology in eSim consisting two NOR Gates and one NOT Gate. When all the inputs are LOW, then only output is HIGH, else LOW for NOR gate and NOT gate inverts the input as output.
## Usage/Examples

Multiplexer

Crystal oscillator

Phase Locked Loop (PLL)
