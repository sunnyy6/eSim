# CD4071 IC

It is 2-input OR Gate IC. CD4071 IC is designed with 180nm CMOS technology in eSim consisting four OR Gates. When both the inputs are LOW then only output is LOW, otherwise HIGH.


## Usage/Examples

In designing basic logic circuits or Alarm circuits for example alarm for a car door system can be designed using this IC.

Encoders

Decoders

We can design Multiplexers of any size and also De-multiplexers.
