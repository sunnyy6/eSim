# CD4069 IC

CD4069 is Hex NOT Gate IC. It is designed with 180nm CMOS technology in eSim consisting six NOR Gates. When all the input is LOW, then only output is HIGH, and vice-versa. It is also known as Inverter Gate.
## Usage/Examples

Logic inversion

Pulse shaping 

Oscillators 

High-input-impedance amplifiers
