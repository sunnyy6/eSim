# CD4077 IC

It is 2-input XNOR Gate IC. CD4077 IC is designed with 180nm CMOS technology in eSim consisting four XNOR Gates. It plays the role of even 1â€™s detector. When both inputs are same, then output is HIGH, else LOW. It is also known as Special logic Gate.

## Usage/Examples

Logical Comparators

Adders, Subtractors

Parity Generators and Checkers

Touch sensor circuit
