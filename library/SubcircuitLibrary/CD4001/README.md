# CD4001 IC

It is 2-input NOR Gate IC. CD4001 IC is designed with 180nm CMOS technology in eSim consisting four NOR Gates. When both the inputs are LOW then only output is HIGH, otherwise LOW. It is also called inverted OR Gate, a type of Universal Gate.


## Usage/Examples

The IC can be used for Noise Removing.

Also used in devices such as PCs and notebooks.
